# cypress-ticket-specs

My intention with this project is to improve my Cypress framework skills. It tests a simple ticket website and its functionalities.

You can find automated tests that:
- Navigates to a page;
- Maps fields using CSS selectors;
- Inputs value to text boxes;
- Checks and unchecks check-boxes;
- Selects combo-box options;
- Use cypress commands to repeat filling similar data;
- Asserts header content being displayed;
- Assert buttons displayed as enabled or disabled;
- Clicks on buttons;
- Overall 9 automated tests were made.
